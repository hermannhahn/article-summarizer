# Use Cases & Examples

This document provides practical examples of how to use the Article Summarizer CLI for common business and personal tasks.

## Example 1: Monitoring Competitor News for Business Intelligence

Imagine a technology company wants to analyze a news article about a competitor's financial results to include in an internal market intelligence report.

### Command (Local Installation)

```bash
python main.py --url "https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/24/23930342/microsoft-msft-q1-2024-earnings" --style narrative --language "en" --output "microsoft_q1_2024_earnings_summary.pdf"
```

### Command (Docker)

```bash
docker run -v "$(pwd):/app/output" article-summarizer --url "https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/24/23930342/microsoft-msft-q1_2024_earnings.pdf" --style narrative --language "en" --output "output/microsoft_q1_2024_earnings_summary.pdf"
```

### What This Command Does:

-   `--url "..."`: Specifies the link to the news article to be summarized.
-   `--style narrative`: Requests the summary to be generated as a flowing text, in paragraph style, which is ideal for reports and analysis.
-   `--language "en"`: Sets the summary language to English.
-   `--output "..."`: Saves the summary directly to a file named `microsoft_q1_2024_earnings_summary.pdf`.

### Business Utility:

-   **Competitor Monitoring**: Strategy or marketing teams can use this command to quickly process and archive news about competitors.
-   **Report Generation**: The generated PDFs can be easily attached to emails, shared in internal communication channels (like Slack or Teams), or compiled into market intelligence reports.
-   **Time Savings**: Instead of multiple employees reading the full article, they receive a concise, standardized summary, optimizing time and ensuring everyone has the same baseline information.
-   **Knowledge Base**: The company can build an archive of summaries on important topics, creating a knowledge base for future reference.

## Example 2: Summarizing a Technical Article for a Development Team

A software development team needs to quickly understand the key takeaways from a long technical blog post about a new programming framework. They want a bulleted list to share in their team's chat.

### Command (Local Installation)

```bash
python main.py --url "https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19" --style bullet_points --language "en" --output "react_19_summary.txt"
```

### Command (Docker)

```bash
docker run -v "$(pwd):/app/output" article-summarizer --url "https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19" --style bullet_points --language "en" --output "output/react_19_summary.txt"
```

### What This Command Does:

-   `--url "..."`: Provides the URL of the technical blog post.
-   `--style bullet_points`: Requests the summary as a concise list of key points, which is perfect for quick reading and easy digestion.
-   `--language "en"`: Ensures the summary is in English.

### Business Utility:

-   **Technical Onboarding**: Quickly bring team members up to speed on new technologies or concepts without requiring them to read lengthy documentation.
-   **Efficient Knowledge Sharing**: The bulleted format is perfect for sharing in team chats or for adding to internal wikis (like Confluence or Notion).
-   **Decision Making**: Helps teams quickly assess whether a new technology is relevant to their projects by providing a high-level overview of its features and benefits.
-   **Reduces Information Overload**: Allows developers to stay current with industry trends without being overwhelmed by the volume of available content.
